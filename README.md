## :bulb: Project description
To keep track of our day-to-day life at an emotional level, we are going to create a diary in **Laravel** using *Inside Out* characters where we can insert what we are feeling every day.
***

## Requirements we need to achieve in this project:

- We must **view** our **entire journal** on the screen **(blade)**

- We must **view** our **entire Journal** on the screen through **Endpoints** *(blade)*.

- We must be able to **insert**,**modify** and **delete** an entry through **Endpoints**.

- The **date** and *time* of the entry creation should be **automatically added**.
***

## :scroll: Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Please make sure that you have Composer and XAMPP correctly installed for the database to work.
> If you can't install xampp, search for another local server that supports **PHP** and **MYSQL**.
***

### First step 

**Clone** our repository at **Visual Studio**.
```bash
https://github.com/SantiVigna/InsideOut-Project.git
```

> [!NOTE]
> To install **Composer** we must introduce this **command** at **Git Bash**:

```php
 $ composer install
 ```
![composer install](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bff20171-10ab-4bc3-8bc8-efcf91a8228f)

This is what you should see after doing the command.
***

### Second step

Open the **XAMPP** control panel and follow these instructions: 

- Run **Apache's** and **MySQL** modules by pressing **Start**.

- Open **Apache's** **Admin**.
